description: "Rip Foster Rides the Gray Planet is a young adult science fiction novel\
  \ written by Harold L. Goodwin under the pseudonym Blake Savage. The novel was originally\
  \ published by Whitman in hardcover in 1952 and reprinted in the United Kingdom\
  \ later in the same year as Rip Foster Rides the Grey Planet (note the spelling\
  \ of \"gray/grey\"). There were two subsequent American reprints under different\
  \ titles: another hardcover edition as Assignment in Space with Rip Foster in 1958\
  \ and a paperback edition as Rip Foster in Ride the Gray Planet, in 1969. Under\
  \ all titles combined, there were approximately 100,000 copies of the novel printed.\
  \ The first edition was illustrated by E. Deane Cate and the 1958 edition by Denny\
  \ McMains. Goodwin is better known for other children's books he wrote, including\
  \ the Rick Brant Science Adventure Series for Boys. According to Project Gutenberg\
  \ [1], this novel is in the Public Domain in the United States.\n From Wikipedia\
